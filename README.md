# Poker Hands

## Project Overview
"Poker_hands" is a simple program designed to simulate a basic game of poker by generating two hands of 5 cards. The program compares these hands and determines which is stronger, providing a detailed explanation of why one hand wins over the other based on poker hand rankings.

## Features
- Accepts X 5-card poker hands as input from the user.
- Compares the two hands using standard poker hand rankings (e.g., high card, pair, flush, straight, etc.).
- Outputs the winner and a clear explanation of the winning hand.
- Handles ties with appropriate messages.
